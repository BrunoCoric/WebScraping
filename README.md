# WebScraping
Projects where I'm learning web scraping

File doncic.py is a program that takes data from https://basketball-reference.com.
It fetches all the games that Luka Dončić has played and it fetches all the turnovers
he has commited where an opponent has stolen his ball and it shows who has forced him to
commit the most turnovers.

File imdb.py is a program that takes data from https:/imdb.com.
Right now it just plots you the rating of episodes of a series through it's run.
If you search for a movie and pick a movie it doesn't show you anything but rating.
